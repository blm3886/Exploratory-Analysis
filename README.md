# Exploratory-Analysis
-A data exploratory project focused on reducing the efforts in data collection by identifying the prime parameters that play an
important role in training the model.
▪ Trained a logistic regression model with an accuracy of ~84% using Scikit-Learn to predict if an individual has income less than
or more than $50,000.
▪ Used the Adult income dataset from Kaggle and analyzed various demographic and financial parameters to reduce the number of variables to be considered for training without
affecting the accuracy of the income classifier.
